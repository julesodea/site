summaryone: "Tourism New Zealand works with the tourism industry to positively promote New Zealand internationally. They have a new campaign that is aimed at visitors staying for short periods, booking their own accommodation. The task was to create a single page web application that allows users to input information, validate the information and provide meaningful feedback when validation has failed or passed. Display accommodation options to the user based on the information entered."
summarytwo: "Communicating the beauty of the New Zealand landscape was crucial in creating the landing page for NZ Tripfinder. With the use of a Lake Hawea and a simple minimal form enables the user to focus on the experience. Based on the input of the user and what conditions they entered into the travel form available accommodation was suggested. The final booking confirmation was simple and easy to understand. It included how many nights they were staying, price and if they recieved food with their payment or not."
