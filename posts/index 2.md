summaryone: "Black Estate is an award winning winery in Canterbury, New Zealand. The task was to redesign their current website to a more user friendly website. I showcased the impressive restaurant in the landing page with the Canterbury hills in the background. Their wines are crafted by hand, as naturally
as possible. They have received international and domestic acclaim both for the wine
and the food offerings. Their restaurant opens for lunch and has won 2018 Cuisine
Winery Restaurant of the year with two hats. I wanted to try convey the restaurant in a enticing way which would make you really want to be there."
summarytwo: "I wanted to implement a User Interface that is simple and easy to use while still showing off the class of the winery. "
